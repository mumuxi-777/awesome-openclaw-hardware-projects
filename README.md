# Awesome OpenClaw Hardware Projects

> A community collection of OpenClaw hardware projects — enabling AI agents to interact with the physical world.

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) has transformed office automation and content creation, but its connection to the physical world remains underdeveloped. Unlike interacting with internet APIs, hardware integration lacks standardized interfaces and protocols. This field is still in its infancy — but as hardware becomes more accessible and agent-to-physical-world protocols mature, OpenClaw will increasingly power perception and control of the real world.

This repository aggregates projects, skills, and tutorials that bring OpenClaw into the physical realm.
